## Scope :page_with_curl:
This report is focused on studying the trends present in the Amazon Prime TV Shows Dataset, which includes columns containing the Name of the show, Year of release, Number of seasons available, Language, Genre, IMDb rating and Age of viewers. Useful insights were obtained using the provided data on courses from different topics.
 ## Data Design :bar_chart:
 The raw data provided was downloaded in CSV file format from kaggle.com and it came with some of its contents being incorrect and improperly formatted hence, a proper data cleaning had to be done by removing duplicates, renaming cells, creating filters and also deleting empty rows.
 ## Import and Transform Data :scroll:
 After downloading the data which was in CSV file format, I imported the data into Microsoft Excel being the tool I’ll be using for analysis. Then, I selected the folder in which the file was saved, then I selected the CSV.                                                                                                                   <img width="802" alt="Amazon 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130637591/235513178-b8f99b70-fdd6-4de1-83d2-67ffcbbc4021.png">

A description box popped up with details of the CSV and multiple options to click on. I clicked on “Load”.
